### A Sequence-based and Context Modelling Framework for Recommendation (SequenceContextRS)

This code is part of my PhD research work. 

This is a generic activity recommendation framework, which is suitable for generating recommendations based on context-rich user activity patterns. In recent years, the amount of available choices to users have increased drastically, while at the same time there has been a significant rise in pervasive computing and collection of user activity data by individuals and different applications. Recommender systems can leverage such data to help users in the decision making process by suggesting items of interest and discovering new items. The key aspect which differentiates the generic activity recommendation framework proposed in this work from the traditional recommendation approaches is that it considers both sequence and context information in the user activities. It has been argued in this work that it is important to consider both sequences and context in user activities, as they contain information relevant to user preferences. The proposed activity recommendation framework considers sequence and context during the recommendation generation process as well as for the recommended output. 

Further documentation will be provided soon.
